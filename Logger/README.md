James Little and Jack Ward - Mobile Computing, Bowdoin College, Fall 2016 Final Project

An iOS app built for the Northern Bites, Bowdoin's Standard Platform League RoboCup team, that facilitates video streaming and image collection from the team's robots.

The app was built in Xcode 8 using Swift 3, to be used with iOS 10.

NMSSH is a bit tricky to compile and sign. If you run into problems with that, email jrward@bowdoin.edu.

Make sure you're on the ROBOTICS network to connect to the bots.
