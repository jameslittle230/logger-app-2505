Logger App To Do
Ordered by priority
12-6-2016


Missing functionality/Crashy bugs:

- Fix segue bugs, get segues hooked together properly
    - Incl. the stop-stream thing... wth is going on?
- We've got the create and read part of core data down, now we just need to do update and delete to complete our CRUD
- Create set detail view and hook it up to core data
- Uploading to Dover -- save credentials
    - We need to have a privacy policy somewhere if we want to save login credentials and publish to the app store -- this is a convo
- Fix the bug where core data isn't saved across launches


Making the app better/nicer to use:

- Switch to using streams for the robot selection checker
- Go through LogViewController and make sure everything is multithreaded properly
- Get better data checking -- what if a log doesn't have an image? What happens if it's not a tripoint log?
- Properly send the binary code to turn tripoint logging on
- Replace the big "record" button with the thing from the mockup
- Tab View Controller images


If we wanted to launch this today:

- Some way to determine which the selected log is in the filmstrip
- NMSSH compiled for wrong processor. Let's fix this so we can demo it on the phone
- Replace the splash screen :(
- Maybe check to see if you're on the ROBOTICS network to stream?
- Maybe check to see if you're on the Bowdoin network so you can upload to dover?
